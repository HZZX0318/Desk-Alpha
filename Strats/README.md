# Strategies Folder

## Guidelines:
1. Keep each algorithm in it's own folder. 
2. Note who came up with the idea, communicate with them on Slack through #desk-alpha when you do anything to it. 
3. Start in Py, if it's promising swap into C++. 
4. After coding up in Py, PLEASE test before C++
5. You can only assume price data. Desk will be working on library to calculate everything more easily.
