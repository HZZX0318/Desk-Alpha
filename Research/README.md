# Research Folder Guide

## If you are a RESEARCHER:
You have two main options: Explain your idea in a markdown (.md) file, or code up a basic interpretation in Python (.py). Devs will grab it, backtest it, and get back to you on that. 

## If you are a DEVELOPER:
You use the strategies folder. Grab ideas from here and chuck them into backtest. One way or another, they will be moved out.
